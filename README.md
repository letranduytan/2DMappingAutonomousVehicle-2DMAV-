## Project Idea

In the era of **Industry 4.0**, mobile robotics and autonomous vehicles have become one of the most essential research areas.  
These systems can **navigate, avoid obstacles, localize, and build maps (SLAM)** — all of which are foundational technologies for self-driving cars, logistics robots, and drones.

The **Mobile Path-Finding Robot** project aims to develop a **small-scale autonomous vehicle** capable of:
- Moving autonomously and avoiding obstacles.  
- Collecting environmental data through multiple sensors.  
- Transmitting data to a computer for **2D mapping and analysis**.  
- Serving as a research platform for **navigation, localization, and intelligent control algorithms**.

## Objectives

1. Enable the robot to **move and navigate** autonomously.  
2. **Detect and avoid obstacles** using ultrasonic and laser distance sensors.  
3. **Measure motion parameters** using encoder and IMU sensors.  
4. **Transmit real-time sensor data** to a computer via Wi-Fi or UART.  
5. **Process and reconstruct a 2D environment map** from collected data.
